# All About Subgraphs

We present carefully curated list of Subgraphs resources. **If you find the list helpful, please make sure to ⭐ star it!**

A subgraph extracts data from a blockchain, processing it and storing it so that it can be easily queried via GraphQL.

> The subgraph definition consists of a few files:

- _**subgraph.yaml**_: a YAML file containing the subgraph manifest

- _**schema.graphql**_: a GraphQL schema that defines what data is stored for your subgraph, and how to query it via GraphQL

- _**AssemblyScript Mappings**_: AssemblyScript code that translates from the event data to the entities defined in your schema
